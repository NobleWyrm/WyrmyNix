# This is my configuration!

It looks like this for now, nothing amazingly special ATM.

# TODO:

- Find a better way to implement temporary /etc/hosts overrides, I suspect there has to be a way to do it with Nix Environments, but I haven't touched those yet.
- Disentangle Hyprland, it's spread between the core system and the user packages, which isn't great.
- Also disentangle my home-manager profile in general, it'd be nice to be able to have a simplified version I could just drop into a Kali installation when I can't use my NixOS setup.
